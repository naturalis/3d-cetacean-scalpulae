# Image Processing
Image processing is performed by ConvertBackground.bash. Another example can be found in the script Examples_IM.bash. These scripts can be executed in the terminal when ImageMagick is installed. 
```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```
The script can be run by copy and pasting into the terminal and changing the parameters.
